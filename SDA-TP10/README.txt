All sources are in ./src, all tests in ./test
I am using java 8 language level, and JUnit 4 for the tests.
Working directory of project should be the root of project (input is opened as "res/sda_graph.txt" and output is
written in "out/MST.out").
The main class is MinimumSpanningTree, it contains the main(...) method.
To compile, build and run everything (tests and main) I used my IDE (IntelliJ IDEA 2016). Should work fine with eclipse.

I choosed to use java's HashMap and HashSet (sometimes linked implementations) instead of using my own structures.
Those classes are already optimised and work perfectly, so I was able to focus on the implementation.
